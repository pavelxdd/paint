# Simple Paint

A simple paint application created with C and SDL3.

## ðŸ¤– Disclaimer

This repository is an experiment in AI-driven software development. Its purpose is to test various tools and workflows in which a Large Language Model (LLM) acts as the primary code author.

The development process consists of a human providing high-level tasks and objectives. In response, an AI generates all source code and subsequent modifications. This project, therefore, serves as a practical exploration of using AI as a software engineering tool.

## Features

- **Basic Drawing Tools**: Includes a standard brush and a semi-transparent "water marker".
- **Blur Tool**: A tool to smudge and blur parts of the drawing, creating soft, blended effects.
- **Emoji Brush**: Select from a shuffled grid of emojis to paint with.
- **Resizable Brush**: Change the brush size with the mouse wheel or keyboard shortcuts.
- **Color Palette**: A dynamic color palette is generated based on window size. Click to select a
    color, or middle-click to set the background.
- **Straight Line Mode**: Hold `Ctrl` or toggle with `Ctrl`+`Ctrl` to draw straight lines. Hold
    `Shift` while drawing a straight line to snap to horizontal or vertical axes.
- **Simple UI**: The UI is minimal, with tool selectors and palettes that adjust to the window
    size.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with SDL3, it should compile and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
