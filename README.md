## ðŸ¤– Disclaimer

This repository is an experiment in AI-driven software development. Its purpose is to test various tools and workflows in which a Large Language Model (LLM) acts as the primary code author.

The development process consists of a human providing high-level tasks and objectives. In response, an AI generates all source code and subsequent modifications. This project, therefore, serves as a practical exploration of using AI as a software engineering tool.
